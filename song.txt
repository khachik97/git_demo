Hello
It's me
I was wondering 
If after all these years you would like to meet me
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello
how are you?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
